Absolutely! Here's a complete, **detailed documentation** of what you're building: a **Multi-Tenant Helpdesk Ticket Management System**, using **Spring Boot** as the backend with an H2 database (for now), and a scalable architecture that can grow into a full SaaS product.

---

## 🚀 Project: Multi-Tenant Helpdesk API (Backend - Spring Boot)

---

### ✅ What We're Building

We are developing a **Multi-Tenant Ticket Management System** — a backend platform where multiple companies (called **tenants**) can register and operate their own **isolated helpdesk systems**, all within a single application instance.

This is the **backend-only** portion, using:

* Java 17+
* Spring Boot (RESTful APIs)
* Spring Security (JWT-based auth)
* H2 (in-memory DB for development)
* Scalable folder structure and clean architecture

---

## 🧱 What We’ve Done So Far

### ✅ 1. **Project Initialization**

* Created root project folder: `Multi-Tenant-Helpdesk-API`
* Inside it, created `helpdesk-api-backend` for Spring Boot backend
* Used [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) to generate a Spring Boot starter project with:

  * Spring Web
  * Spring Security
  * Spring Data JPA
  * H2 Database
  * Lombok

### ✅ 2. **Git Setup**

* Initialized Git repo in the root folder
* Added `.gitignore` to ignore unnecessary files like:

  * `/target/`, `.idea/`, `node_modules/`, sensitive `*.properties`
* Pushed project to GitHub:
  👉 `https://github.com/karan0704/Multi-Tenant-Helpdesk-API`

### ✅ 3. **Folder Structure Planning**

* Designed the backend structure using clean architecture:

```
helpdesk-api-backend/
└── src/main/java/com/karan/helpdesk
    ├── controller
    ├── service
    ├── repository
    ├── entity
    ├── dto
    ├── security
    ├── tenant
    └── config
```

### ✅ 4. **Generated Java Class Stubs**

* Used a Python script to auto-create all the Java class files inside the correct package folders
* Each class is ready for implementation with a clean separation of concerns

## 🎯 What This Application Will Do (Key Features)

| Feature                        | Who Uses It                    | Description                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Multi-Tenant Support         | All                            | Each company (tenant) has isolated users and tickets |
| ✅ User Authentication          | All                            | JWT-based login (with tenant scope)                  |
| ✅ Role-Based Access            | Employee, Engineer, Manager    | Each user role has different permissions             |
| ✅ Ticket Management            | Employees, Engineers, Managers | Create, assign, resolve tickets                      |
| ✅ Filtering & Search           | Managers                       | Filter tickets by priority, status, date, etc.       |
| ✅ Analytics Dashboard (future) | Managers                       | Ticket counts, engineer workload, charts             |
| ✅ Tenant Registration          | Public                         | New companies can register themselves                |
| ✅ Secure Architecture          | All                            | Tenants can’t access other tenants' data             |
| ✅ Scalable Folder Structure    | Developers                     | Clean code separation for future growth              |

---

## 🔒 Security Highlights

* Uses **JWT** (JSON Web Token) for stateless authentication
* Each request carries a token that includes `tenantId` and `role`
* Custom `TenantContext` holds the `tenantId` per request (ThreadLocal)
* Spring Security intercepts unauthorized access based on role and tenant
* Passwords are **hashed** (e.g., with BCrypt)

## 🌱 Scalability Plan

This system is built to **grow into a full SaaS product**. Here's how it's scalable:

| Scalable Feature            | Future Enhancement Idea                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Multi-Tenant Architecture | Add row-level security, or schema-based isolation                   |
| ✅ Modular Codebase          | Easily plug in new modules (chat, analytics, billing)               |
| ✅ H2 to MySQL Switch        | Swap database in `application.properties`                           |
| ✅ DTO and Service Layers    | Abstracted business logic for cleaner upgrades                      |
| ✅ Config Profiles           | Use `application-local.properties`, `-dev`, `-prod`                 |
| ✅ Future Frontend           | Angular 16+ app to consume these APIs                               |
| ✅ Ready for SaaS Billing    | Add Stripe or Razorpay integration                                  |
| ✅ Role Extensibility        | Add roles like "Customer", "QA", etc. without breaking architecture |

## 🔄 Workflow Example (Real-World Usage)

### 👤 **Employee Workflow**

1. Logs in using email/password
2. Creates a ticket with title, description, priority, tags
3. Sees the list of their own tickets and status

---

### 🔧 **Engineer Workflow**

1. Logs in → Sees "unassigned tickets"
2. Accepts a ticket → status becomes `IN_PROGRESS`
3. Adds notes → resolves ticket → status becomes `RESOLVED`

---

### 👨‍💼 **Manager Workflow**

1. Logs in → views dashboard with all tickets of their company
2. Filters by status/priority/date
3. Manages engineers and ticket assignments
